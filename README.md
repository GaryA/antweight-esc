=============

Yet Another Antweight Speed Controller - code to re-purpose brushless ESCs as brushed motor speed controllers.

By re-programming commonly- and cheaply-available brushless motor ESCs we can have cheap, light and robust ESCs 
that are more than capable of driving the small gearmotors commonly used in antweight robots.

This project provides code for ESCs based on the common Silicon Laboratories 8051F330 microcontroller. 
The vast majority of small ESCs now use this microcontroller rather than the Atmel ATMega series. 
The project will require community support if it is to grow to support further ESCs. All contributions 
of hardware, schematics or software will be welcomed!
